# GAN from Scratch using Keras 

This repository contains my basic implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Keras. The goal of this project is to understand how GANs work by building one from the ground up without relying on prebuilt classes.

##  What I Learned
- The working mechanism of GANs: Generator and Discriminator dynamics.
- How to train GANs using alternating training loops.
- How to generate synthetic data (digits from MNIST) using deep learning.
- Learned to tune hyperparameters, loss functions, and evaluate generated results.

##  Dataset
- MNIST handwritten digits dataset (from `keras.datasets.mnist`)
